            <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
            <p>1. My name is Lilia Jimenez. I am a rising junior at WashU. I am a BFA in Com Des with a minor in Art History and Marketing.<p>
            <p>2. Honestly, coding really scares me. I took this class as it is a requirement for Com Des BFAs but I am excited to learn a little bit about coding and applying it to design. <p>
            <p>3. I have zero experience.</p>
            <p>4. I hope to build skills that make designing in a digital space easier.</p>
            <p>5. At first I think creating on the screen will be very challenging but eventually I think the ability to go back and delete in a way that is impossible on paper will be interesting and beneficial.</p>
            <p>6. Mejuri is a jewelry brand that has an effective website. Often times, I find fashion and shopping websites to be overwhelming but this design maintained its elegance and sophistication (mejuri.com). </p>
            <p>7. Bon Appetit is one of my favorite food blogs and places to find recipes (bonappetit.com) It is very minimal and easy to follow despite how much information it hold which makes it easy to navigate.</p>
            <p>8. The New York times is also an effective site as it organizes information in a simple manner that still looks nice to the eye.</p>
