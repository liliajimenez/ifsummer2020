    <h2>Self Reflection:</h2>
    <section>
        <li>In the next rendition, it might be more effective if the shaded boxes were not the length of the page but rather looked more like buttons and rougly the size of the text.</li>
        <li>I think there should also be more pictures. Perhaps next rendition I can include pictures of each of the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Higher contrast between the headers and the background.</li>
        <li>Add more detail such as yield and time the recipe takes.</li>
        <li>Page almost appears like a column. I hope to add more interest and float different asides such as health facts or tips to make the layout more interesting.</li>
        <li>The sections could be clearer, the ingredients and the instructions are almost bleeding into each other.</li>

        <li>Make the text content larger to balance image size</li>

        <li>Add more space between ingredients and instructions, way too tight and hard to read</li>
        <li>Add more pictures</li>
        <li>Be consistent with line height and make line height larger to make the page more airy and less condensed</li>

        <h2>Conclusion & Moving Forward:</h2>
        <p>Moving forward I plan to work on layout and making it more cohesive and interesting. My page has strengths in terms of color palette and more aesthetic choices but needs work in terms of structure. I will make my page more complex by adding more images and creating more clear sections. After discussing with my group, I looked around the internet and am drawing inspiration from Bon Appetit and as well as my other group members. Seri created a fun aside for tips and tricks related to her recipe which is something I am excited to add. Emily experimented with changing the radius of her imaged to create an interesting round border effect.</p>
