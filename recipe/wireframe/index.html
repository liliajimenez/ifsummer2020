    <h2>This drink has a surprising earthy sweetness and brightness. Tiger nuts are tiny—and deliciously sweet—root vegetables that are packed with prebiotics. So this is a good-for-your-gut tonic that’s actually nut-free. If tiger nuts are out of reach, swap in coconut flakes (no need to soak) or your favorite nut or seed.</h2>
    <h3>Serves 4</h3>
